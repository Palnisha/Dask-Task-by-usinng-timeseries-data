# Dask Task

This project demonstrates how to handle time series data with Dask, including creating a sample dataset, preprocessing, resampling, filtering, and visualizing results. By using Dask's parallel computation features, we can efficiently process and analyze large time series datasets.

# Project Overview:

In this example, we will:

. Create a sample time series dataset.
. Load the dataset with Dask.
. Preprocess the data (handling missing values, converting timestamps).
. Perform time-based operations like resampling, filtering, etc.
. Visualize the results (optional, Dask also integrates well with libraries like matplotlib for plotting).
